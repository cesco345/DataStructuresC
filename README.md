# DataStructuresC

We continue to refine and enhance algorithms and data structures. Using a C implementation, we try to  highlight conceptual topics, focusing on ADTs and the analysis of algorithms for efficiency as well as performance and running time. We cover greedy algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, randomized algorithms, and backtracking. We go over some current topics and newer data structures such as Fibonacci heaps, skew heaps, binomial queues, skip lists, and splay trees. We will go into amortized analysis that examines the advanced data structures, and how to implement   advanced data structures covering red black trees, top down splay trees, treaps, k-d trees, pairing heaps, and more. We use Mark Allen Weiss seminal book on ADT on C.
